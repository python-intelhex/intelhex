About
*****
The Intel HEX file format widely used in microprocessors and microcontrollers 
area as the de-facto standard for representation of code for programming 
microelectronic devices.

This work implements an **intelhex** Python library to read, write, 
create from scratch and manipulate data from HEX (also known as Intel HEX) 
file format. These operations are provided by ``IntelHex`` class.

The distribution package also includes several convenience Python scripts
to do basic tasks that utilize this library. The ``bin2hex.py`` script 
converts binary data to HEX, and the ``hex2bin.py`` works the other direction. 
``hex2dump.py`` converts data from HEX to a hexdump which is useful for
inspecting data, and ``hexmerge.py`` merges multiple HEX files into one.
In addition you can try to inspect differences between 2 HEX files with
``hexdiff.py`` utility which uses dump output similar to ``hex2dump.py``.

You can find IntelHex library on PyPI:

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~
This work was partially inspired by SRecord_ software in that moment
when I've stuck with its limitations and unintuitive behavior.

So I've made this library and related tools which gives me 
full control over data and HEX file creation.
