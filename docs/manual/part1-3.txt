Installation
************
IntelHex may be downloaded from:

http://www.bialix.com/intelhex/intelhex-1.0.zip

IntelHex is distributed as a standard Python Distutils package. 
Assuming Python is properly installed on your platform, 
installation should just require running the following command 
from the root directory of the archive::

    sudo python setup.py install

This will install the intelhex package into your system's site-packages 
directory and place the helper scripts in your Python site-packages 
binaries directory. After that is done, any other Python scripts or modules 
should be able to import the package using::

    >>> from intelhex import IntelHex

The scripts should be in your PATH so that they can be called from anywhere 
in the file system.

See the Python distutils website for more information, or try typing, 
``python setup.py --help`` from the root directory of the archive.
