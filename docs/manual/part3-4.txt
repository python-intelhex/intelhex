**********************************
This is a script to merge two different hex files. It is a frontend for the
``merge`` function in ``IntelHex`` class.
::

    Usage:
        python hexmerge.py [options] FILES...

    Options:
        -h, --help              this help message.
        -o, --output=FILENAME   output file name (emit output to stdout
                                if option is not specified)
        -r, --range=START:END   specify address range for output
                                (ascii hex value).
                                Range can be in form 'START:' or ':END'.
        --no-start-addr         Don't write start addr to output file.
        --overlap=METHOD        What to do when data in files overlapped.
                                Supported variants:
                                * error -- stop and show error message (default)
                                * ignore -- keep data from first file that
                                            contains data at overlapped address
                                * replace -- use data from last file that
                                             contains data at overlapped address
                                * identical -- raise error if data differ


    Arguments:
        FILES       list of hex files for merging
                    (use '-' to read content from stdin)

    You can specify address range for each file in the form:

        filename:START:END

    See description of range option above.

    You can omit START or END, so supported variants are:

        filename:START:     read filename and use data starting from START addr
        filename::END       read filename and use data till END addr

    Use entire file content:

        filename
    or
        filename::
